        This simple page will serve as a demonstration of simple tags and will be self-documenting, utilising comments thoroughly and used as a reference point for myself. Some of the basic tags are listed below:
    </p>

    <!--
        "<ul></ul>" - These tags are used to create an 'un-ordered' list; bullet points.
        "<ol></ol>" - These tags are used to create an 'ordered' list; a numbered list.

        "<li></li>" - Both lists use this tag to denote a separate item in the list.
    -->
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; - These tags are used to create paragraphs and separate blocks of text.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
