    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This dish has become a favourite in our house for the sticky, sweet taste, flavour-filled bites and speed to make. It is a hit for the adults and young children, down to my middle one at age 4! Sadly, it's frowned upon to feed a 3 month old solid food yet, but will be trying her with this dish as soon as we can.
