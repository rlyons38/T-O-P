            This simple page will serve as a demonstration of simple tags and will be self-documenting, utilising comments thoroughly and used as a reference point for myself. Some of the basic tags are listed below:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lists">
    <!--
        "<ul></ul>" - These tags are used to create an 'un-ordered' list; bullet points.
        "<ol></ol>" - These tags are used to create an 'ordered' list; a numbered list.

        "<li></li>" - Both lists use this tag to denote a separate item in the list.
    -->
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; - These tags are used to create paragraphs and separate blocks of text.</li>
                <li>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - These tags are used to add importance to specific text, whilst making it appear bold.</li>
                <li>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - These tags are used to add emphasis to specific text, whilst making it appear italic.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="links">
    <!--
        "<a></a>" - This is an anchor tag, and is used to link text to other areas of the same page or other web-pages entirely.
        
        Anchor tags require a HTML attribute. These are additional information added inside the opening tag and are usually made up of two parts: a name and a value.

        "<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/"></a>" - This would be a working link, without the HTML attribute (href - Hyperlink Reference), the anchored text will not know where to link to.
        
        Additionally, adding the 'href' attribute will now add the hyperlink styling be default, making it look like we expect a hyperlink to look like. Without this attribute, an anchor will default to looking like standard text.
    -->
        <p>
            For more information and a much more detailed list of available tags and their uses, a previous TOP lesson linked a handy website to use as a reference point: <a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The DevDocs reference page has a full list of HTML attributes, elements and even lists obsolete content so you can make sure you are not using something that is or will be out of support in the near future. A full list of useful links will be on my <a href="Fundamentals/ReferencePoints/Resources.html">Resources</a> page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--
        "<img>" - This is an image tag. It is different from other tags in the way that it has no closing tag; this is called self-closing.
        The image tag uses the HTML attribute "src", which tells the browser where the image file is located for it to embed it into the page.
        It can use absolute and relative paths; the difference being an absolute path points to another website to reference the image, and a relative path points to an image in our own website / folder structure.

        Example:

        <img src="ReferencePoints/Images/charles.jpg" alt="Image of Charles the dog.">
       
        This will embed the JPG image stored in the specified folder onto the webpage.

        As best practice, every image element should have an "alt" attribute as seen in the above example. This stands for "alternative text" and is used to describe the image, replacing the image if it cannot be loaded and used by screen readers for visually impaired users.
