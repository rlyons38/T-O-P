    <!--
        "<p></p>" - Paragraph tag. Use it to identify a block of text.
        "<b></b>" - Bold tag. Used only to mark text as bold.
        "<strong></strong>" - Importance tag. Use it to force the text inside these tags to be bold and marked as important text.
        "<i></i>" - Italic tag. Used only to mark text as italic.
        "<em></em>" - Emphasis tag. Use it to force the text inside these tags to be italic and marked with emphasis.

        <p>
            <b>T</b>he <b>O</b>din <b>P</b>roject is a self-paced learning course that I will be using to refresh my knowledge in HTML and CSS, then expand it with Javascript and possibly Ruby. Whilst my main career focus is not web-development, learning these languages and skills are sure to be valuable in my career <em>at some point</em>. Expanding my skillset early can only open more doors and turn me into that useful employee that every employer wants.
        </p>

        <p>
            This simple page will serve as a demonstration of the HTML and CSS tags learnt, slowly expanding and improving with each lesson learnt. It will be self-documenting in the form of thorough internal commenting and used as a reference point for myself.

        <!--
        "<ul></ul>" - These tags are used to create an 'un-ordered' list; bullet points.
        "<ol></ol>" - These tags are used to create an 'ordered' list; a numbered list.

        "<li></li>" - Both lists use this tag to denote a separate item in the list.
        -->
        <p>
            Some of the basic HTML tags are:

            <ul>
                <li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; - These tags are used to create paragraphs and separate blocks of text.</li>
                <li>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - These tags are used to add importance to specific text, whilst making it appear bold.</li>
                <li>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - These tags are used to add emphasis to specific text, whilst making it appear italic.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the basic CSS controls are:

            <ul>
                <li>background-color - Sets the background-color for selected elements. This has been used as a main page background, using the hex colour codes.</li>
                <li>font-family - Using this on a selected element will use the specified font for the text. This can be entered as a comma separated list for fallback fonts as well.</li>
                <li>padding - This is used to create white space inside a selected element. Just one tool used for content placement and space buffering.</li>
            </ul>

            CSS controls are nested inside a selector block. These can be elements like the HTML tags above, or more specific class tags which can be created to identify content. This also makes the CSS reusable across multiple blocks of content if they are all identified as the same class but using different HTML tags for the content.

    <!--
        "<a></a>" - This is an anchor tag, and is used to link text to other areas of the same page or other web-pages entirely.
        
        Anchor tags require a HTML attribute. These are additional information added inside the opening tag and are usually made up of two parts: a name and a value.

        "<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/"></a>" - This would be a working link, without the HTML attribute (href - Hyperlink Reference), the anchored text will not know where to link to.
        
        Additionally, adding the 'href' attribute will now add the hyperlink styling be default, making it look like we expect a hyperlink to look like. Without this attribute, an anchor will default to looking like standard text.

            For more information and a much more detailed list of available tags and their uses, a previous TOP lesson linked a handy website to use as a reference point: <a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The DevDocs reference page has a full list of HTML attributes, elements and even lists obsolete content so you can make sure you are not using something that is or will be out of support in the near future. A full list of useful links will be on my <a href="Fundamentals/ReferencePoints/Resources.html">Resources</a> page.

    <!--
        "<img>" - This is an image tag. It is different from other tags in the way that it has no closing tag; this is called self-closing.
        The image tag uses the HTML attribute "src", which tells the browser where the image file is located for it to embed it into the page.
        It can use absolute and relative paths; the difference being an absolute path points to another website to reference the image, and a relative path points to an image in our own website / folder structure.

        Example:

        <img src="ReferencePoints/Images/charles.jpg" alt="Image of Charles the dog.">
       
        This will embed the JPG image stored in the specified folder onto the webpage.

        As best practice, every image element should have an "alt" attribute as seen in the above example. This stands for "alternative text" and is used to describe the image, replacing the image if it cannot be loaded and used by screen readers for visually impaired users.
