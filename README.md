# T-O-P

This is my personal **T**he **O**din **P**roject repo where I will be going through their lessons from the start and documenting as I go to expand my personal knowledge. I will break these down into stages with separate folders where I can, the logical structure likely changing a few times during the course of the lessons.

## Fundamentals

I have created a fundamentals folder to contain all the lessons and resources needed when working through the fundamentals course of **TOP**.
