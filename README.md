# T-O-P

This is my personal **T**he **O**din **P**roject repo where I will be going through their lessons from the start and documenting as I go to expand my personal knowledge. I will break these down into stages with separate folders where I can, the logical structure likely changing a few times during the course of the lessons.

## Fundamentals

I have created a fundamentals folder to contain all the lessons and resources needed when working through the fundamentals course of **TOP**. An information dump that will be great to refer back to will be on the [Resources](/Fundamentals/HTML/ReferencePoints/Resources.html) page, linking useful tools and pages.

A list of projects from the fundamentals course, source location and live page links will be listed here:

### Recipe's Site

The recipe's site project focused on building on the HTML taught and putting it all together, the idea was for a main page with linked pages for each recipe, pictures and content. Nothing fancy in the inital commits, just HTML.
